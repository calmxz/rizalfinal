                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>During Rizal's era, travel was a luxury accessible to only a few due to its expense and limited
                    transportation options. Unlike today's swift air travel, people relied on steamers, horses,
                    trains, and walking to traverse distances.

                    <br><br>Rizal wasn't just a tourist; he was a scholar of
                    the cultures he encountered, traveling to expand his knowledge, particularly in the fields of
                    science and literature. This article will delve into Rizal's various journeys, the wisdom he
                    gained,
                    friendships forged, places visited, and events witnessed.

                    <br><br>It will explore his fascination
                    with different cultures alongside his critical observations. Moreover, it will highlight how
                    Rizal's
                    accumulation of knowledge and skills contributed to the eventual downfall of Spain's 333-year
                    reign
                    in the Philippines.

                <h2>Childhood Travels</h2>
                <p>During Rizal's birth, his mother nearly died due to his large head, prompting his family to
                    promise
                    the Virgin of Antipolo that if she aided his mother's recovery,
                    they would take him to her sanctuary. His journey began in Calamba, where he delighted in
                    moonlit
                    walks. Accompanied by his father, he embarked on his first pilgrimage
                    to Antipolo in 1868, leaving behind his mother, who had just given birth to Trinidad.

                    <br><br>Crossing
                    Laguna de Bay on a casco for the first time, Rizal was awestruck by the
                    vast water and the serenity of the night, staying awake in wonder. After visiting the Virgin of
                    Antipolo and Saturnina in Manila, they returned to Calamba, where Rizal
                    occasionally reflected on the shore, laying the groundwork for his adventurous spirit.

                <h2>Schooling in Biñan</h2>
                <p>In June 1869, on a Sunday afternoon, amidst tearful farewells from his family, he departed
                    Calamba
                    for Biñan, accompanied by his brother Paciano, in a carromata, a light,
                    two-wheeled vehicle drawn by a native pony. After a brief drive, they reached their aunt's
                    house,
                    where Jose was to stay, arriving almost at nightfall. That same evening,
                    his cousin Leandro explored the town.

                    <br><br>His life in Biñan was marked by simplicity and routine, where
                    he encountered his first school fight, took painting lessons, and excelled
                    academically. Eventually, as his schooling concluded, he received news from his sister Saturnine
                    about the arrival of the steamer Talim, which would transport him back to Calamba.

                    <br><br>After bidding farewell to his teachers and classmates, he left Biñan on a Saturday
                    afternoon
                    in
                    December 1870, having spent a year and a half there. During the journey aboard the
                    steamer Talim, which filled him with excitement, he encountered a Frenchman, a friend of his
                    father,
                    who looked after him.

            <div>
                <h2>Schooling at Ateneo de Manila</h2>
                <p>Following the martyrdom of Gom-Bur-Za, Jose ventured to Manila to pursue his studies, enrolling
                    at
                    Ateneo Municipal. His inaugural day commenced with a Mass at the college chapel.
                    <br><br>Despite starting at the bottom of his class, by month's end, he ascended to the rank of
                    'emperor'.
                    After the academic year concluded in March 1873, Rizal returned to Calamba for summer
                    break, where he visited his imprisoned mother and was warmly embraced by her.
                    <br><br>Upon resuming
                    studies
                    in Manila for his second year, he prophesied his mother's liberation, a prediction
                    that materialized. Engrossed by Dr. Feodor Jagor's "Travels in the Philippines", Rizal was
                    captivated by Jagor's critique of Spanish colonization and his foresight of Spain's eventual
                    loss of the Philippines. <br><br>In his third year, news of his mother's release buoyed his spirits,
                    and
                    by
                    his fourth year, he resided as an interno at Ateneo. Encouraged by his professor Fr.
                    Francisco de Paula Sanchez, Rizal delved deeper into his studies and poetry writing. Graduating
                    in
                    1877 with distinction in all subjects, he concluded his schooling journey.

                <h2>Medical Studies at <br>University of Santo Tomas</h2>
                <p>After completing his first year in Philosophy and Letters, Rizal switched to the medical course.
                    Despite his mother's objections, his father and brother Paciano supported his decision.
                    At the University of Santo Tomas, he continued his education, winning literary accolades and
                    engaging in romantic pursuits. <br><br>During his time there, he encountered the brutality of a
                    Spanish
                    officer, fell in love with Miss L, and penned 'To the Filipino Youth'. <br><br>In May 1881, Rizal
                    embarked
                    on a pilgrimage to Pakil, accompanied by his sisters and their friends. They traveled by
                    Casco from Calamba to Pakil, Laguna, where they were captivated by the renowned turumba,
                    witnessing
                    the fervent street dances during the procession honoring the miraculous Birhen Maria de los

                <h2>Course to Spain</h2>
                <p>Continuing his studies at the University of Santo Tomas, Rizal grew disillusioned with the
                    Dominican
                    institution's teaching methods and the racial bias of its professors towards Filipino students.
                    Upon completing the fourth year of his medical course, he decided to pursue further studies
                    abroad,
                    despite predicting his parents' disapproval and choosing not to seek their blessing. <br><br>Besides
                    his
                    academic pursuits in Spain, Rizal undertook a clandestine mission to meticulously observe
                    European
                    life, culture, languages, customs, industries, commerce, government, and laws. This mission
                    aimed
                    to equip him for the monumental task of liberating his oppressed compatriots from Spanish
                    tyranny.
                    The journey to Spain marked the beginning of Rizal's extensive travels.</p>

                <h2>Departure for Spain</h2>
                <p>To evade detection by Spanish authorities and friars, Rizal's departure for Spain was shrouded in
                    secrecy, even from his own parents who would have objected. Only a select few, including his
                    older
                    brother, uncle, sisters Neneng and Lucia, the Valenzuela family, Pedro Paterno, Mateo
                    Evangelista,
                    the Ateneo Jesuit fathers, and close friends, were privy to his plans. <br><br>The Jesuit priests
                    provided him with letters of recommendation to their counterparts in Barcelona, where he adopted
                    the
                    pseudonym Jose Mercado. Before leaving, he penned farewell letters to his beloved parents and
                    sweetheart, Leonor Rivera. <br><br>On May 3, 1882, Rizal embarked on the Spanish steamer Salvadora
                    bound
                    for
                    Singapore. With tears in his eyes and a heavy heart, he watched Manila's skyline fade into the
                    distance, capturing the moment in a sketch as it disappeared from view.</p>

                <h2>Singapore</h2>
                <p>On May 3, 1882, during the voyage, Rizal attentively observed his fellow passengers and the
                    ship's
                    surroundings aboard the steamer. <br><br>Among the sixteen passengers, he was the lone Filipino,
                    accompanied by Spaniards, British individuals, and Indian Negroes. Building a friendship with
                    the
                    ship's captain, Donato Lecha, Rizal engaged in chess matches to alleviate boredom, consistently
                    proving his prowess in the game. <br><br>Upon the Salvadora's arrival in Singapore on May 9, Rizal
                    lodged at
                    Hotel de la Paz and embarked on a two-day exploration of the city. <br><br>His sightseeing excursion
                    included visits to the renowned Botanical Garden, captivating Buddhist temples, bustling
                    shopping

                <h2>To Colombo</h2>
                <p>After a brief stay in Singapore, Rizal embarked on the French steamer Djemnah bound for Europe on
                    May
                    11. Compared to his previous vessel, the Djemnah was larger and cleaner, accommodating more
                    passengers. <br><br>Despite encountering challenges in communicating with the predominantly
                    French-speaking
                    passengers, Rizal attempted to converse in French, only to realize that his proficiency was
                    insufficient. Resorting to a mixture of Spanish, Latin, and sketching on paper, he managed to
                    communicate effectively and gradually improved his grasp of the French language through daily
                    interactions with fellow passengers. <br><br>On May 17, the Djemnah reached Point Galle, a coastal
                    town
                    in
                    southern Ceylon, which failed to impress Rizal. Continuing their voyage, they arrived at
                    Colombo,
                    the capital of Ceylon, the next day. Rizal was captivated by Colombo's scenic beauty and elegant
                    architecture, finding the city to be truly remarkable.</p>

                <h2>Through Suez Canal</h2>
                <p>Continuing its journey from Colombo, the Djemnah sailed across the Indian Ocean towards the Cape
                    coast of Africa, where Rizal caught sight of the barren shoreline for the first time, describing
                    it
                    as an 'inhospitable land but famous'. <br><br>Their next port of call was Aden, where Rizal
                    experienced
                    sweltering heat surpassing that of Manila and marveled at his first encounter with camels.
                    Subsequently, the ship made its way to Suez, a pivotal city at the Red Sea terminal of the Suez
                    Canal. <br><br>Upon disembarking, Rizal explored the city, particularly enchanted by the serene
                    moonlight
                    reminiscent of his hometown Calamba and family. It took five days for the Djemnah to traverse
                    the
                    Suez Canal, a thrilling experience for Rizal as he journeyed through a canal built by Ferdinand
                    de Lesseps. <br><br>Upon reaching Port Said, Rizal disembarked once again to explore the city's
                    captivating
                    sights and was intrigued by the diverse inhabitants conversing in a multitude of languages.</p>

                    picturesque scenery. <br><br>He was particularly captivated by the sight of Mount Vesuvius, the

                    of
                    St. Elmo, and other historic landmarks. The following night, on June 12, the steamer docked at

                <h2>Barcelona</h2>
                <p>On the afternoon of May 15, Rizal departed from Marseilles by train, bound for Spain. Crossing
                    the
                    Pyrenees, he made a stopover in the frontier town of Port Bou for passport inspection before
                    continuing his journey by rail. <br><br>Finally arriving in Barcelona on June 16, 1882, Rizal's
                    initial
                    impression of the city was unfavorable, deeming it ugly, dirty, and its residents inhospitable.
                    However, his perception gradually changed, and he grew to appreciate Barcelona as a vibrant city
                    exuding an atmosphere of freedom and liberalism. He found its people to be open-hearted,
                    hospitable,
                    and courageous, and enjoyed leisurely strolls along Las Ramblas, the famous street in Barcelona.
                    <br><br>Welcomed by fellow Filipinos, who were former classmates from Ateneo, Rizal was treated to a
                    party
                    at
                    Café Plaza de Cataluña, where he shared the latest news and gossip from the Philippines.
                    <br><br>During
                    his
                    time in Barcelona, Rizal penned a nationalistic essay titled "Amor Patrio," his first written
                    work
                    on Spanish soil, which he sent to Basilio Teodoro Moran, publisher of Diariong Tagalog.
                    Impressed by
                    the article, Moran encouraged Rizal to write more. <br><br>Amidst living in Barcelona, Rizal
                    received
                    distressing news of a cholera outbreak devastating Manila and the provinces, causing many deaths
                    and
                    leaving his beloved Leonor Rivera visibly affected by his absence. <br><br>Additionally, prompted by
                    advice
                    from his brother Paciano, Rizal decided to continue his medical studies in Madrid, leading him
                    to
                    depart from Barcelona in the fall of 1882.

                <p>On November 3, 1882, Rizal commenced his studies at the Universidad Central de Madrid, pursuing
                    courses in Medicine and Philosophy and Letters. <br><br>In addition to his academic endeavors, he
                    dedicated

                    also
                    undertaking private lessons in French, German, and English. Furthermore, he diligently practiced
                    fencing and shooting at the Hall of Arms of Sanz y Carbonell. <br><br>Adopting a modest lifestyle in
                    Madrid,
                    Rizal remained focused on his purpose of preparing himself for service to his homeland. He
                    managed his finances and time meticulously, abstaining from gambling, indulgence in wine, and
                    frivolous pursuits with women. <br><br>On Saturday evenings, he frequented the home of Don Pablo
                    Ortiga

                    Rey,
                    a former mayor of Manila, where he formed a close relationship with Don Pablo, his son, and
                    daughter. Rizal eventually became romantically involved with Consuelo Ortiga y Perez, Don
                    Pablo's
                    daughter,
                    drawn to her beauty and vivacity amid his loneliness in a foreign land. <br><br>However, their love
                    affair
                    faced challenges as Rizal was still engaged to Leonor Rivera, and a close friend of his was also

                <h2>First Visit to Paris</h2>
                <p>In June 1883, Rizal departed Madrid for Paris, where he initially stayed at the Hotel de Paris
                    before
                    relocating to more affordable accommodations. Like any tourist, he marveled at the enchanting
                    sights of Paris, including the picturesque boulevards, the Opera House, Place de la Concorde,
                    the
                    Arc de Triomphe, Bois de Boulogne, the Madeleine Church, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Vendome
                    Column,
                    Les Invalides, and Versailles. He immersed himself in French culture, spending countless hours
                    exploring museums and closely observing the French way of life. <br><br>During his time in Spain,
                    Rizal
                    forged
                    close ties with influential Spanish liberals and republicans, many of whom were Freemasons.
                    Impressed by their outspoken criticism of government policies and the friars, Rizal joined the
                    Masonic
                    lodge Acacia in Madrid in March 1883, seeking their support in his struggle against the friars
                    in
                    the Philippines. He later transferred to Lodge Solidaridad, where he attained the rank of Master
                    Mason on November 15, 1890, and received a diploma from Le Grand Orient de France in Paris.
                    <br><br>Meanwhile, back in Calamba, circumstances worsened as droughts and locusts devastated
                    harvests,
                    exacerbating the financial strain on Rizal's family due to increased rents imposed by the
                    Dominican-owned hacienda. Consequently, Rizal often experienced delays or even lack of
                    allowances,
                    causing
                    significant hardship. <br><br>In November 1884, Rizal participated in student demonstrations
                    advocating
                    for
                    academic freedom, particularly in support of Dr. Miguel Morayta's liberal views, which were
                    denounced by the Catholic bishops of Spain. <br><br>On June 21, 1884, Rizal completed his medical
                    studies in
                    Spain, receiving the degree of Licentiate in Medicine from the Universidad Central de Madrid. In
                    the following academic year, he successfully passed all subjects leading to the degree of Doctor
                    of
                    Medicine, while also achieving excellent ratings in his studies in Philosophy and Letters.

                    his homeland in the future. <br><br>In 1885, at the age of 24, Rizal left the Central University of
                    Madrid and traveled to Paris to further his knowledge in ophthalmology. Along the way, he
                    stopped in
                    Barcelona to visit his friend Maximo Viola, also a medical student from a wealthy family in
                    Bulacan. <br><br>Arriving in Paris in November of that year, Rizal spent approximately four months
                    there,
                    apprenticing under Dr. Louis de Wecker, a renowned French ophthalmologist, which significantly
                    enhanced his expertise in the field. When not at Dr. Wecker's clinic, Rizal socialized with
                    friends, including the Pardo de Taveras family, Juan Luna, and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo.
                    <br><br>He
                    particularly
                    enjoyed spending time in Luna's studio, where they discussed art and Rizal even posed for some
                    of
                    Luna's paintings, notably appearing as one of the Egyptian priests in Luna's work "The Death of
                    Cleopatra."

                <h2>At Heidelberg</h2>
                <p>Leaving Paris on February 1, 1886, after gaining valuable experience at Dr. Wecker's clinic,
                    Rizal
                    embarked on a journey to Germany. Making stops in Strasbourg and other German towns, he arrived
                    in Heidelberg on February 3, 1886. This historic city, renowned for its ancient university and
                    picturesque surroundings, became his temporary home. <br><br>Initially lodging with German law
                    students
                    in a
                    boarding house, Rizal's adeptness at chess earned him membership in the Chess Player's Club. He
                    later moved to a boarding house near the University of Heidelberg, where he worked at the
                    University
                    Eye Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Otto Becker and attended lectures by Dr. Becker and Prof.
                    Wilhelm Kuehne. <br><br>During weekends, he explored the scenic spots around Heidelberg, including
                    the
                    majestic Heidelberg Castle, the enchanting Neckar River, theaters, and old churches. Rizal
                    admired
                    the harmonious coexistence of German Catholics and Protestants, noting their practice of
                    ecumenism. <br><br>On April 22, 1886, amid the springtime bloom in Heidelberg, Rizal penned a poem
                    to
                    the
                    vibrant flowers along the Neckar River, particularly cherishing the forget-me-nots. He then
                    enjoyed a three-month summer vacation in Wilhelmsfeld, a quaint mountain village near
                    Heidelberg,
                    residing at the vicarage of the kind Protestant pastor, Dr. Karl Ullmer. <br><br>On July 31, 1886,
                    Rizal
                    composed his first letter in German to Professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, intrigued by
                    Blumentritt's
                    interest in Philippine languages. Along with the letter, Rizal sent a copy of Aritmetica.
                    Impressed by Rizal's gesture, Blumentritt reciprocated by sending him gift books, marking the
                    beginning of their enduring correspondence. <br><br>Rizal was fortunate to witness the fifth
                    centenary
                    celebration of the University of Heidelberg on August 6, 1886, just days before his departure, a
                    bittersweet occasion as he had grown fond of the land and the beautiful city.</p>

                <h2>Leipzig and Dresden</h2>
                <p>On August 9, 1886, three days following the fifth centenary celebration of the University of
                    Heidelberg, Rizal departed the city, boarding a train to embark on a journey across various
                    cities
                    in
                    Germany. <br><br>Arriving in Leipzig on August 14, 1886, he attended lectures at the University of
                    Leipzig
                    and forged friendships with Professor Friedrich Ratzel, a renowned German historian, and Dr.
                    Hans
                    Meyer, a German anthropologist. During his time in Leipzig, Rizal undertook the task of
                    translating
                    William Tell from German to Filipino, aiming to familiarize Filipinos with the story of the
                    Swiss champion of independence. <br><br>Additionally, he translated Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy
                    Tales
                    into Filipino. Benefiting from the city's affordable cost of living, Rizal remained in Leipzig
                    for two and a half months, utilizing his time to revise chapters of his second novel and engage
                    in
                    physical exercise. <br><br>He also worked as a proof-reader at a publishing firm, earning additional
                    income. Departing Leipzig on October 29, 1886, Rizal proceeded to Dresden, where he briefly met
                    Dr.
                    Adolph Meyer, the director of the Anthropological and Ethnological Museum, before continuing his
                    journey. <br><br>Despite his brief stay in Dresden, Rizal was deeply moved by the music during a
                    Catholic
                    Mass he attended, describing it as profoundly sublime. On the morning of November 1, 1886, Rizal
                    departed Dresden by train, arriving in Berlin later that evening.</p>

                <h2>Berlin</h2>
                <p>Rizal found Berlin appealing for its scientific atmosphere and lack of racial prejudice. Here, he
                    had
                    the opportunity to meet Dr. Feodor Jagor, author of Travels in the Philippines, a work Rizal
                    greatly admired for its insightful observations on the Philippines. <br><br>Through Dr. Jagor,
                    Rizal
                    was
                    introduced to Dr. Rudolf Virchow, a renowned anthropologist, and his son, Dr. Hans Virchow, a
                    professor of Descriptive Anatomy. Rizal also worked alongside Dr. Karl Ernest Schweigger, a
                    prominent German ophthalmologist, during his time in Berlin. <br><br>His accomplishments in
                    Berlin
                    were
                    remarkable, becoming the first Asian honored with membership in prestigious societies such as
                    the
                    Anthropological Society, the Ethnological Society, and the Geographical Society of Berlin.
                    <br><br>Recognizing Rizal's intellectual prowess, Dr. Virchow invited him to deliver a lecture
                    before
                    the
                    Ethnographic Society of Berlin, where Rizal presented a scholarly paper titled Taglische
                    Verkunst
                    (Tagalog Metrical Art), receiving acclaim from the scientific community. <br><br>Despite his
                    rigorous
                    academic pursuits, Rizal led a disciplined life in Berlin, balancing his assistant duties during
                    the
                    day with attending lectures at night. He maintained his physical fitness through daily exercise
                    and
                    diligently practiced languages such as German, French, and Italian. <br><br>Rizal also took
                    private
                    French lessons under Madame Lucie Cerdole to master the language. In his leisure moments, Rizal
                    explored the countryside surrounding Berlin, immersing himself in the local culture and
                    sketching
                    his observations. He was particularly captivated by German Yuletide customs, such as decorating
                    pine
                    tree branches with lanterns, papers, and candies. <br><br>Additionally, Rizal found the German
                    tradition of self-introduction intriguing, where individuals would bow their heads and
                    personally
                    greet each guest in a room. However, not all experiences in Germany were favorable for Rizal.
                    <br><br>During one harsh winter, he endured poverty when financial support from Calamba ceased,
                    leaving
                    him
                    with only one meal a day and forcing him to wash his own clothes due to lack of funds for
                    laundry. Despite efforts by his brother Paciano to raise funds, the failure of crops and
                    collapse of
                    the sugar market in Calamba exacerbated their financial struggles.

                <h2>Noli Me Tangere published in Berlin</h2>
                <p>During his time in Berlin, Rizal faced challenges in publishing "Noli Me Tangere," but with the
                    assistance of Maximo Viola, who provided both funds for publication and living expenses, the
                    novel
                    became a reality. As they joyfully celebrated Christmas in 1886, the chief of police's sudden
                    visit
                    to Rizal's boarding house raised concerns. <br><br>Unable to produce a passport, Rizal faced the
                    threat
                    of deportation. Despite his efforts, Rizal failed to obtain a passport within the given
                    timeframe,
                    but his explanation of being a Filipino physician and scientist, not a French spy, convinced the
                    authorities to allow him to remain in Germany. <br><br>When "Noli Me Tangere" was finally
                    printed on
                    March
                    21, 1887, Rizal promptly shared copies with close friends, dedicating the novel to the
                    Philippines. Its profound depiction of the country's struggles resonated deeply with readers,
                    including influential figures like Blumentritt, who praised the novel's authenticity and
                    heartfelt
                    narrative, recognizing it as a significant literary achievement.</p>

                <h2>Blumentritt and Leitmeritz</h2>
                <p>On May 13, 1887, at 1:30 p.m., Rizal and Viola arrived at Leitmeritz railroad station, where they
                    were warmly welcomed by Professor Blumentritt, who recognized them thanks to a sketch Rizal had
                    previously sent. <br><br>Their meeting marked the beginning of a profound friendship, with
                    Blumentritt
                    immediately taking Rizal to heart. During their stay, they enjoyed the hospitality of
                    Blumentritt's
                    family, relishing the cooking of his wife Rosa and cherishing moments spent with their children.
                    <br><br>Blumentritt introduced them to the scenic and historical wonders of Leitmeritz,
                    including a
                    visit
                    to a local beer garden where Rizal's fluency in German left the townsfolk astonished. They also
                    attended a meeting of the Tourists’ Club, where Rizal's linguistic skills garnered further
                    admiration. <br><br>As a gesture of gratitude, Rizal painted a portrait of Blumentritt, and they
                    bid
                    farewell to their gracious host and his family on May 16, carrying with them cherished memories
                    of
                    their time in Leitmeritz.

                    from Blumentritt to Professor Willkomm of the University of Prague. <br><br>Welcomed warmly by

                    Blumentritt,
                    they met with Norfenfals, a celebrated novelist of the time, who was deeply impressed by Rizal's

                    they

                    June 2 to 3, 1887, before journeying onward to Basel, Bern, and Lausanne. <br><br>Following

                    on June 27, 1887. The grandeur and historical significance of the Eternal City left him thrilled
                    and captivated. On June 29th, he had his first visit to the Vatican, the center of Catholicism
                    and
                    the seat of the Pope. <br><br>The magnificence of St. Peter's Church and the Vatican's other
                    structures
                    made a profound impression on him, especially as it coincided with the feast day of St. Peter.
                    <br><br>Despite his exhaustion from days filled with sightseeing, Rizal found solace in his rest
                    at
                    the
                    hotel.
                    In a letter to Blumentritt, he humorously expressed his fatigue, likening it to that of a dog's,
                    yet
                    anticipated the rejuvenation of sleep. <br><br>With his return to the Philippines looming, Rizal

                    of
                    his journey. Yet, his love for his homeland and nationality remained steadfast. <br><br>Despite

                    friars,
                    Rizal resolved to return to the Philippines in August 1887. His motivations included the desire
                    to restore his mother's sight and to gauge the impact of his literary work on Filipino society.
                    <br><br>Departing from Rome by train to Marseilles, he embarked once again on the steamer
                    Djemnah,

                    tempered by concerns for his safety. <br><br>Paciano, ever vigilant, remained by his side to

                    out.
                    Setting up a medical clinic in Calamba, his first patient was his nearly blind mother, drawing
                    attention as news spread of the skilled doctor returned from Germany. <br><br>Patients from

                    and
                    beyond sought his consultations, earning him a substantial income within a month. Additionally,
                    he
                    established a gymnasium to promote European sports and discourage local vices like cockfighting
                    and
                    gambling. <br><br>Despite his efforts, Rizal was unable to reunite with Leonor Rivera, his
                    beloved.
                    Shortly after his return, he received a letter from Governor General Emilio Terrero, summoning
                    him
                    to Malacañan Palace. <br><br>At the meeting, Rizal defended himself against accusations stemming
                    from
                    his novel, "Noli Me Tangere," asserting that it merely portrayed truths and not seditious ideas.
                    <br><br>Pleased with his explanation, Terrero requested a copy of the book, which Rizal promised
                    to
                    provide.
                    Recognizing the danger Rizal faced from powerful friars, Terrero assigned a Spanish lieutenant
                    as
                    his bodyguard for protection.

                <h2>Farewell Again</h2>
                <p>Rizal's novel provoked outrage among the friars, leading to anonymous threats against his life
                    that
                    deeply concerned his parents. Recognizing the danger, they urged him to leave for his own
                    safety.
                    Governor General Terrero intervened, advising Rizal to depart the Philippines to avoid the fury
                    of
                    the friars' vengeance. Although reluctant, Rizal felt compelled to comply with the governor
                    general's directive. Thus, in 1888, he left Calamba behind.</p>

                <p>Haunted by enemies and threatened by the influence of the friars, Rizal was compelled to depart
                    the
                    Philippines once again in February 1888, at the age of 27. He carried with him the weight of
                    disillusionment and frustration, a victim of the injustices of humanity and a thwarted advocate
                    for
                    reform. <br><br>Setting sail aboard the Zafiro on February 3, 1888, after a six-month stay in
                    Calamba,
                    Rizal endured illness and melancholy during the turbulent voyage across the China Sea, opting to
                    remain on board during a stopover at Amoy due to sickness and unfavorable weather conditions.
                    <br><br>Arriving in Hong Kong on February 8, he took up residence at the Victoria Hotel, where
                    he
                    received a
                    warm welcome from the Filipino community. <br><br>However, his movements in Hong Kong were
                    closely
                    monitored by a Spaniard named Jose Varanda, believed to be spying on Rizal under orders.

                    where he was surprised to encounter the familiar figure of Sainz de Varanda among the
                    passengers.
                    <br><br>Describing Macao as small, low, and somber, Rizal noted the prevalence of junks and

                <h2>Japan</h2>
                <p>One of the happiest periods in Rizal's life was his time in Japan, where he spent one and a half
                    months from February 28 to April 13, 1888. <br><br>Captivated by Japan's natural beauty, the

                    its
                    people, and the picturesque shrines, he found solace and romance amidst his sorrows, even
                    falling in
                    love with a Japanese woman whose loveliness brought joy to his heart. <br><br>Arriving in

                    on
                    the morning of February 28, he lodged at the Grand Hotel before moving to Tokyo the next day,
                    where
                    he stayed at the Tokyo Hotel until March 7. <br><br>Despite his initial struggles with the
                    language,
                    he
                    soon began studying Japanese, eventually becoming conversant within a few days. <br><br>Invited

                    Juan
                    Perez Caballero, secretary of the Spanish Legation, to stay at the Spanish Legation, Rizal
                    accepted,
                    aware of the Spanish government's monitoring but forming a close friendship with Caballero
                    nonetheless, whom he described as young, refined, and a talented writer. <br><br>Immersing
                    himself
                    in
                    Japanese
                    culture, Rizal studied drama, arts, music, and judo, exploring museums, libraries, art
                    galleries,
                    and shrines, and visiting picturesque villages like Meguro, Nikko, Hakone, and Miyanoshita.
                    <br><br>Impressed by a performance of Western music by the Tokyo band in a park, he was
                    surprised to
                    discover they were Filipino musicians and conversed with them in Tagalog. <br><br>Despite his
                    admiration
                    for
                    Japan's natural beauty, the cleanliness, politeness of its people, and the charm of its women,
                    he
                    disliked the use of rickshaws drawn by men, finding it distasteful.

                    affectionately called O-Sei-San. Their shared interests in the arts ignited a deep connection
                    and
                    blossoming romance. <br><br>Entranced by Seiko's beauty, charm, modesty, and intelligence, Rizal
                    found
                    happiness in her company and was tempted to settle down in Japan, especially given the enticing
                    job
                    offer from the Spanish Legation. <br><br>However, his unwavering love for his homeland and his

                    to
                    liberate his oppressed people compelled him to reconsider. Though their love was profound, Rizal
                    ultimately made the difficult decision to depart from Japan. <br><br>Boarding the Belgic, an
                    English
                    steamer, on April 13, 1888, from Yokohama bound for the United States, Rizal left Japan with a
                    heavy
                    heart, knowing he would never again behold its beauty or his beloved O-Sei-San. <br><br>Despite

                    United
                    States. During the journey, a child on board approached him, asking if he knew a man named
                    "Richal" in Manila, to which Rizal amusingly replied that he was "Richal" himself. <br><br>The
                    child's
                    excitement at discovering they were traveling with a celebrity brought pride to their mother.
                    Additionally, Rizal formed a bond with Tetcho Suehiro, a Japanese journalist and advocate for
                    human
                    rights, who was forced to leave Japan. <br><br>Initially alone due to his proficiency in
                    Japanese,
                    Rizal befriended Tetcho and acted as his interpreter throughout their voyage from Yokohama to
                    San
                    Francisco, across the U.S. to New York, and finally to London, where they parted ways.
                    <br><br>Sharing
                    his life story and mission for emancipation from Spanish tyranny, Rizal inspired Tetcho, who in
                    turn
                    encouraged Rizal to strengthen his crusade for human rights in his homeland. <br><br>On December
                    1,
                    1888, after eight months of friendship, Rizal and Tetcho bid each other farewell with a final

                    by
                    the stark reality of racial prejudice, witnessing discriminatory treatment towards Chinese and
                    African American individuals by white Americans. <br><br>Despite this, he formed both positive

                    negative
                    impressions of the United States. He admired the country's material progress, the vigor and

                    and

                <h2>San Francisco</h2>
                <p>Upon the steamer Belgic's arrival in San Francisco on Saturday morning, April 28, 1888, all
                    passengers were barred from disembarking due to quarantine measures imposed by American health
                    authorities, citing a supposed cholera epidemic originating from the Far East, a claim Rizal
                    found
                    dubious. <br><br>Alongside fellow passengers, he protested this unjustifiable action, later
                    discovering
                    it was politically motivated due to the presence of 653 Chinese coolies on board.
                    <br><br>Finally
                    permitted
                    to go ashore on Friday afternoon, May 4, Rizal registered at the Palace Hotel, where he stayed
                    for two days until May 6. Departing for Oakland on May 6 via ferry boat, he enjoyed breakfast in
                    Reno, Nevada, the following morning. <br><br>Continuing his journey, he passed through various
                    states,
                    including Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, and Illinois, arriving in Chicago on May 11, where he noted
                    the
                    prevalence of cigar-selling stores adorned with Indian figures. <br><br>On May 12, he marveled
                    at
                    the
                    beauty of Wagner Car and the Niagara Falls before reaching Albany on May 13, admiring the scenic
                    Hudson River. <br><br>The transcontinental journey concluded on Sunday, May 13, when Rizal
                    arrived
                    in
                    New
                    York, where he spent three days exploring scenic and historic sites, including the awe-inspiring
                    memorial of George Washington. <br><br>Departing for Liverpool on May 16, 1888, aboard the City
                    of
                    Rome,
                    he
                    bid farewell to New York, catching a glimpse of the colossal Statue of Liberty as the ship
                    sailed
                    away from the harbor, ending his memorable trip to America.

                <h2>Once Again in London</h2>
                <p>Rizal settled in London from May 1888 to March 1889, motivated by three primary reasons.
                    <br><br>Firstly,
                    he
                    sought to enhance his proficiency in the English language, recognizing its increasing
                    importance in global communication and diplomacy. <br><br>Secondly, he aimed to study and
                    annotate
                    Antonio
                    de Morga's "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas," a historical work rumored to be accessible at the
                    British Museum, furthering his research on Philippine history and colonialism. <br><br>Lastly,
                    London
                    provided a refuge from the oppressive reach of Spanish tyranny, offering Rizal a safe haven to
                    pursue
                    his intellectual endeavors without fear of persecution or reprisal.

                <p>Rizal's trans-Atlantic voyage aboard the luxurious City of Rome proved to be an enjoyable
                    experience,
                    during which he garnered numerous friends from diverse nationalities owing to his adeptness as

                    weapon.
                    <br><br>Arriving in Liverpool, England in May 1888, Rizal spent one day in the city, lodging at

                <h2>Life in London</h2>
                <p>On May 25, 1888, Rizal arrived in London, initially staying at the residence of Dr. Antonio Ma.
                    Regidor, a lawyer. Shortly thereafter, he became a boarder with the Beckett family, whose home
                    was
                    conveniently located near public parks and within walking distance of the British Museum.
                    <br><br>Immersing
                    himself in research, Rizal dedicated most of his time at the museum, meticulously studying
                    Morga's "Sucesos" and other rare historical texts pertaining to the Philippines. <br><br>His
                    Sundays
                    were
                    often spent at the home of Dr. Rost, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs librarian renowned for his
                    expertise in Malayan languages and customs, who was impressed by Rizal's knowledge and
                    character,
                    leading to recommendations to the British Museum authorities. <br><br>Dubbing Rizal "a pearl of
                    a
                    man,"
                    Dr. Rost spoke highly of him. Over the course of ten months in London, Rizal delved deeply into
                    his
                    historical studies, while his compatriots in Spain advocated for Philippine reforms. <br><br>In
                    September 1888, he briefly visited Paris to scour the Bibliotheque Nationale for additional
                    historical materials, enjoying the hospitality of Juan Luna and his wife during his stay.
                    <br><br>After
                    completing his research, he returned to London. Later, on December 11, 1888, Rizal journeyed to
                    Spain, where he visited Madrid and Barcelona, connecting with fellow compatriots and assessing
                    the
                    political climate. <br><br>It was during this trip that he met Marcelo H. Del Pilar and Mariano
                    Ponce,
                    prominent figures in the Propaganda Movement, exchanging ideas and pledging cooperation in the
                    struggle for reforms.

                <h2>Christmas in London</h2>
                <p>Upon returning to London on December 24, Rizal celebrated Christmas and New Year's Day with the
                    Beckett family, finding solace in the festive atmosphere and reflecting on cherished memories of
                    his
                    infancy intertwined with the significance of Christ's birth. Mrs. Beckett gifted him a book
                    titled
                    "The Life and Adventures of Valentine Vox, the Ventriloquist," adding to his literary
                    collection.
                    <br><br>During his London sojourn, Rizal assumed the role of honorary president of Asociacion La
                    Solidaridad, a patriotic society advocating for reforms, which was inaugurated on December 31,
                    1888.
                    He
                    penned his inaugural article for La Solidaridad, titled "Los Agricultores Filipinos," published
                    on
                    March 25, 1889. <br><br>Amidst his busy schedule, Rizal authored several works, including "La
                    Vision
                    del
                    Fray Rodriguez" and "Letter to the Young Women of Malolos," along with contributing articles to
                    Dr.
                    Rost's journal, "Specimens of Tagal Folklore" and "Two Eastern Fables." <br><br>Additionally,
                    Rizal
                    found
                    himself enamored with Gertrude, one of the Beckett sisters. On March 19, 1889, bidding farewell
                    to
                    the Beckett family, Rizal departed London for Paris, filled with sadness as he left behind
                    countless
                    cherished memories in the city that had become a significant chapter in his life.

                <h2>Universal Exposition of 1889</h2>
                <p>In the spring of 1889, Rizal journeyed to Paris, captivated by the city's bustling atmosphere
                    spurred
                    by the Universal Exposition. Accommodations were scarce due to the event's high demand,
                    prompting landlords to hike rents. <br><br>Initially lodging with his friend Valentin Ventura,
                    Rizal
                    later
                    found a place with two fellow Filipinos, Capitan Justo Trinidad and Jose Albert, after hopping
                    between various hotels. Amidst the festivities, he became the godfather to the daughter of Juan
                    Luna
                    and Paz Pardo de Tavera, Maria de la Paz, born on June 24, 1889. <br><br>Entranced by the Expo's
                    marvels, particularly the iconic Eiffel Tower, Rizal took part in an art competition but left
                    empty-handed. He was also struck by the proud American Indians he encountered, urging his
                    companions
                    to emulate their unapologetic identity. Establishing the R.D.L.M. Society in Paris, Rizal aimed
                    to
                    disseminate knowledge and uplift the Malay race. <br><br>Delving deep into Philippine history,
                    he
                    penned
                    "The Indolence of the Filipinos" and became a member of the "International Association of
                    Filipinologists." Celebrating Christmas in Paris with Jose Albert, Rizal scraped together funds
                    for
                    a
                    modest feast. After a brief New Year's visit to London, he returned to Paris, where the onset of
                    influenza swept through the city. <br><br>In January 1890, he ventured to Brussels, accompanied
                    by
                    Jose
                    Albert, to focus on completing his second novel, "El Filibusterismo." In Brussels, Rizal
                    immersed
                    himself in writing, contributing to La Solidaridad and engaging in medical activities and
                    gymnastics. <br><br>Advocating for the Filipinization of the Tagalog orthography, Rizal remained
                    committed
                    to his homeland despite distressing news of agrarian strife and familial struggles.
                    <br><br>Cherishing
                    the summer festivities and a budding romance with Petite Jacoby, Rizal's time in Brussels was
                    marked
                    by both sorrow and moments of joy.

                <p>In Ghent, Belgium, Rizal sought affordable printing options for his novel, "El Filibusterismo,"
                    owing
                    to limited funds. After careful deliberation, he secured a deal with the F. Meyer-Van Loo Press,
                    agreeing to pay in installments. <br><br>To meet the initial payment and subsequent partial
                    payments,
                    Rizal
                    resorted to pawning all his jewels. However, when financial constraints threatened to halt the
                    printing process, Ventura, upon learning of Rizal's plight, promptly provided the necessary
                    funds.
                    <br><br>With Ventura's assistance, the printing of "El Filibusterismo" resumed, marking a
                    pivotal
                    moment
                    in Rizal's literary endeavors. In a gesture honoring the memory of the martyred priests
                    Gom-Bur-Za,
                    Rizal dedicated the novel to their noble sacrifice.

                <p>In November 1891, Rizal departed Europe for Hong Kong, where he resided until June 1892. Aboard
                    the
                    steamer Melbourne from Marseilles, he commenced writing his third novel in Tagalog during the

                    mostly Europeans, and two Spaniards bound for Amoy. His linguistic prowess impressed fellow
                    passengers. <br><br>Arriving in Hong Kong on November 20, 1891, Rizal was welcomed by Jose Basa
                    and
                    took
                    up
                    residence at Number 5 D' Aguilar Street, where he also established his medical practice.
                    <br><br>The
                    Christmas of 1891 brought joy with the arrival of Rizal's father, brother, Silvestre Ubaldo, and
                    later,
                    his mother and sisters Lucia, Josefa, and Trinidad. <br><br>This family reunion marked one of
                    the
                    happiest
                    moments in Rizal's life. In Hong Kong, Rizal practiced ophthalmology and gained renown as a
                    skilled medical practitioner.

                <h2>Second Homecoming</h2>
                <p>In May 1892, Rizal resolved to return to Manila, entrusting two sealed letters marked "to be
                    opened
                    after my death" to his friend Dr. Marques for safekeeping. <br><br>On June 26, 1892, Rizal,
                    accompanied
                    by his sister Lucia, arrived in Manila and lodged at the Hotel de Oriente facing Binondo Church.
                    The
                    following day, June 27, Rizal traveled by train from Tutuban Station to visit friends, and on
                    July 6, he resumed his interviews at Malacañan Palace. <br><br>During one such visit, the
                    governor
                    general
                    presented him with printed leaflets (Pobres Frailes) allegedly found in Lucia's pillowcases.
                    Despite Rizal's denial and insistence on an investigation, he was arrested and escorted to Fort
                    Santiago. <br><br>On July 15, 1892, Rizal was transferred to the steamer Cebu bound for Dapitan.
                    Upon
                    arrival on July 17, he was handed over to Captain Ricardo Carnicero, the commandant of Dapitan.
                    Rizal's exile in Dapitan lasted until July 31, 1896, spanning four years.</p>

                <h2>Exile in Dapitan</h2>
                <p>Rizal spent four years in Dapitan, where he chose to live in Captain Carnicero's house rather
                    than
                    the Jesuit Church. The two developed a close friendship, with Carnicero impressed by Rizal's
                    character. <br><br>On September 21, 1892, Rizal won 6,200 pesos in the Manila Lottery, which he
                    shared
                    with
                    his father and friend Basa, using the remainder to invest in agricultural lands. During his
                    time in Dapitan, Rizal engaged in debates about religion with Father Pastells and reconnected
                    with
                    his Ateneo teacher, Father Sanchez. Despite religious differences, they remained friends.
                    <br><br>Rizal
                    practiced medicine, offering free services to the poor and performing surgeries, including on
                    his
                    mother's eye. He also established a water system for Dapitan and taught local children while
                    beautifying the town plaza. <br><br>An avid farmer, Rizal introduced modern agricultural methods
                    and
                    machinery to Dapitan. He also had a brief but happy relationship with Josephine Bracken, whom he
                    married in Dapitan. <br><br>On July 31, 1896, Rizal's exile ended, and he boarded the steamer
                    España
                    with
                    Josephine, family, and pupils, bidding farewell to the people of Dapitan. Rizal's last trip
                    abroad
                    began on August 1, with stops in Dumaguete, Cebu, Iloilo, and Romblon before sailing to Manila.
                    <br><br>He
                    then boarded the Spanish cruiser Castilla to Spain, where he was informed of his impending
                    arrest by Governor General Blanco. <br><br>Arriving in Barcelona on October 3, Rizal was taken
                    to
                    Monjuich
                    prison-fortress before being transferred to the ship Colon. <br><br>On October 6, he left
                    Barcelona
                    aboard the Colon under heavy guard.

                <h2>Last Homecoming</h2>
                <p>Rizal's return to Manila on November 3 was met with anticipation from the Spanish authorities. He
                    was
                    transferred to Fort Santiago and underwent a preliminary investigation starting on November 20,
                    facing 15 pieces of documentary evidence against him. <br><br>On November 26, the records were
                    transmitted
                    for further action. Given the right to choose his defense counsel, Rizal selected Don Luis
                    Taviel
                    de Andrade, whose brother had once served as his bodyguard in Calamba. <br><br>On December 13,
                    General
                    Camilo G. de Polavieja assumed the role of Governor General of the Philippines. <br><br>Feeling
                    the
                    weight
                    of
                    his circumstances, Rizal penned a manifesto on December 15, urging his people to seek liberation
                    through education and industry rather than violence. <br><br>As Christmas arrived on December
                    25,
                    1896,
                    Rizal found himself alone and despondent in his prison cell.</p>

                <h2>Trial and Death</h2>
                <p>On December 26, the trial of Rizal commenced, but it was far from fair. The court seemed
                    predetermined to find him guilty, ignoring any evidence in his favor and hastily passing a
                    sentence
                    of death.
                    <br><br>On December 28, General Polavieja ratified the court-martial's decision, scheduling
                    Rizal's
                    execution for December 30 at Bagumbayan Field. During his final days, Rizal was visited by loved
                    ones,
                    including Josephine, Jesuit priests, and friends. <br><br>He penned his last poem and a farewell
                    letter
                    to
                    his best friend, hiding them in an alcohol cooking stove. On the morning of December 30, Rizal
                    faced his execution with dignity. <br><br>Dressed in black, he kissed a crucifix and faced the
                    firing
                    squad,
                    though his request to face them directly was denied. <br><br>Unfazed by fear, he met his fate
                    with
                    courage. As the drums sounded, the order to fire was given, and Rizal fell, his face turned
                    towards
                    the morning sun, a symbol of his unwavering spirit and dedication to his ideals. <br><br>At 7:03
                    a.m.,
                    the life of Jose Rizal, patriot, scholar, and inspiration to many, came to an end.
